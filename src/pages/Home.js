      Alo! My name is Michael H, but I commonly go by Devilking6105.
       I am a self-taught developer passionate about technology and innovation. 
       Feel free to explore my work and by all means reach out and say hi!
       Through my journey with some amazing people,
        I've come to see that we need to love humanity
        and move ourselves into a positive and forward direction
        by helping one another to achieve the goal of peace,
        understanding and love throughout the world.
        We are all we have, embrace humanity.
