      <p>
      I am a proud father
      of 5 amazing kids and married
      to a beautiful and talented nurse.
      I am one of the Co-Founders and Director
      of Help The Homeless Worldwide A NJ Nonprofit Corporation,
      and our cryptocurrency, Help The Homeless Coin.

     Since 2018 I have learned so much about things that I never knew I could get into,
     but I am proud to say that I took a chance, believed in myself, and never gave up.
     Through my own ambitions, my wife nudging me,
     I have dived into learning more and more and fine tuning myself as a developer in today's society. 
     It's awesome to meet you! Thanks for stopping by my React Web4 Application!
